Spring Security homework

Rework your pet project using Spring Security. 
Add authorization for users with different roles (use at least two roles - ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN).
Project should contain pages with restricted access (“only for admins” and “only for users”).
If you don’t have such segregation in your project right now - add some new pages and restrict access to them.
In your SecurityConfiguration use jdbc as a datasource for users and roles.
